                <li><b>100 Continue</b></li>
                <p>This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.</p>

                <li><b>101 Switching Protocols</b></li>
                <p>This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to.</b></p>
                <li><b>103 Early Hints</b></li>
                <p> This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response or preconnect to an origin from which the page will need resources.</p>

            <h1>Success response</h1>
            <p><b>•	200 OK<br></b>
                	Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used.<br>
                <b>•	201 Created<br></b>
                	The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.<br>
                <b>•	202 Accepted<br></b>
                	The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.<br>
                <b>•	203 Non-Authoritative Information<br></b>
                	The server is a transforming proxy (e.g. a Web accelerator) that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the origin's response<br>
                <b>•	204 No Content<br></b>
                	The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content.<br>
                <b>•	205 Reset Content<br></b>
                	The server successfully processed the request, asks that the requester reset its document view, and is not returning any content.<br>
                <b>•	206 Partial Content<br></b>
                	The server is delivering only part of the resource (byte serving) due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by HTTP clients to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams.<br>

        <div class="div3">
            <h1>Redirection messages</h1>
            <p><b>•	300 Multiple Choices:</b>   Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven content negotiation).<br>
                 
               <b> •	301 Moved Permanently: <br></b>   This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
                <br>
                <b>•	302 Found:<br></b>  Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL. The HTTP/1.0 specification required the client to perform a temporary redirect with the same method (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily")<br>
                <b>•	303 See Other: <br></b> The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a new GET request to the given URI.<br>
                <b>•	304 Not Modified <br></b> Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.<br>
                <b>•	307 Temporary Redirect<br></b>   In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI. In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the original request.<br>
                <b>•	308 Permanent Redirect<br></b>   This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI. 308 parallel the behaviour of 301, but does not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.<br>

        <div class="div4">
            <h1>Client Error</h1>
            <p><b>1.	400 Bad Request<br></b>
                o	The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).<br>
                <b>2.	401 Unauthorized<br></b>
                o	Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.<br>
                <b>3.	403 Forbidden<br></b>
                o	The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.<br>
                <b>4.	404 Not Found<br></b>
                o	The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist<br>
                <b>5.	409 Conflict<br></b>
                o	This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server.
            </p>

            <h1>Server error responses</h1>
            <p><b>1.	500 Internal Server Error<br></b>
                o	The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.<br>
                <b>2.	501 Not Implemented<br></b>
                o	The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled. The only methods that servers are required to support (and therefore that must not return this code) are GET and HEAD.<br>
                <b>3.	502 Bad Gateway<br></b>
                o	This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.<br>
               <b> 4.	503 Service Unavailable<br></b>
                o	The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. Note that together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After HTTP header should.<br>
                <b>5.	504 Gateway Timeout<br></b>
                o	This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.<br>
                <b>•	505 HTTP Version Not Supported<br></b>
                o	The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.
